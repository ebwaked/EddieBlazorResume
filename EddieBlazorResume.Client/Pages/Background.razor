<br />

<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
    From studying plant biology to diving into software engineering, <br />
    my journey has been one of transformation and discovery. <br />
    I started with aspirations of dentistry, but life led me down unexpected paths. <br />
    <br />
    After earning my degree in Plant Biology from NC State, I worked as a financial advisor at MetLife. <br />
    While I enjoyed helping clients build security, I found my true passion in coding — <br />
    rediscovered while automating Excel reports, a spark that reminded me of my college programming class. <br />
    <br />
    That realization inspired me to enroll in a coding bootcamp, where I immersed myself in software engineering. <br />
    Surrounded by a supportive cohort, I developed skills that let me turn ideas into reality, <br />
    and I knew I’d found my calling. <br />
    <br />
    Since then, software engineering has been an exciting and fulfilling journey. <br />
    Each day brings new opportunities to learn, create, and solve meaningful problems. <br />
    I’m driven by the chance to innovate and make an impact through technology. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Let’s connect—I’d love to share ideas and collaborate! <br />

    I started building my first site at Coder Foundry, the coding bootcamp I joined and completed in 2015. <br />
    Most of the projects there are outdated and it is not at the standard I have grown to working at. <br />
    But it is a great reminder of where I started and how far I have come. <br />
    Instead of updating that site I decided to learn something new. <br />
