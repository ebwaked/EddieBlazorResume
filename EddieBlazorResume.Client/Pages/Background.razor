<br />

<MudText Typo="Typo.body2">
    From studying the intricate ecosystems of plant biology <br />
    to navigating the complexities of software engineering, <br />
    my journey has been one of transformation, discovery and passion. <br />
    Originally aspiring to pursue a career in dentistry, I eventually <br />
    found my path leading me down unexpected avenues. <br />
    <br />
    After completing my major in plant biology at North Carolina State University, I made the decision <br />
    to venture into the realm of financial advising with MetLife. <br />
    While I found fulfillment in crafting financial plans to increase financial security, <br />
    I discovered that my true passion lay elsewhere. <br />
    It was during this time that I stumbled upon a familiar feeling <br />
    of excitement and fulfillment when I delved into programming tasks, <br />
    particularly automating reports using Excel sheets—a reminiscent echo of my college days in a CSC 201 class. <br />
    <br />
    Driven by this newfound passion for coding, I took a leap of faith and enrolled in a coding bootcamp, <br />
    determined to pursue a career that aligned more closely with my interests and strengths. <br />
    Surrounded by a supportive cohort, I immersed myself in the world of software engineering, <br />
    honing my skills and embracing the opportunity to bring my ideas to life through code. <br />
    <br />
    Since then, my journey as a software engineer has been nothing short of exhilarating. <br />
    From collaborating with my bootcamp cohort in the professional world to <br />
    exploring new technologies and methodologies, <br />
    each day presents an opportunity for growth and innovation. <br />
    <br />
    As I continue to evolve in my career, my passion for building and creating remains steadfast. <br />
    I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible, leveraging technology <br />
    to solve complex problems and make a meaningful impact in the world. <br />
    <br />
    Let's connect and embark on this exciting journey together. <br />

    I started building my first site at Coder Foundry, the coding bootcamp I joined and completed in 2015. <br />
    Most of the projects there are outdated and it is not at the standard I have grown to working at. <br />
    But it is a great reminder of where I started and how far I have come. <br />
    Instead of updating that site I decided to learn something new and create a site that I can slowly build on. <br />
